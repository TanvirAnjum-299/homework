<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Records of pizza-like foods can be found throughout history. In the 6th century BC,  Persian soldiers  baked flatbreads with cheese and dates & the Greeks supplemented their bread with oils, herbs, and cheese. In 2023, archeologists discovered a fresco appearing to depict a pizza-like dish among other foodstuffs and staples on a silver platter. Italy's culture minister said it "may be a distant ancestor of the modern dish". The first mention of the word  comes from a document written in Latin and dating to 997 AD.pizza evolved from  flatbread dishes in  Italy, in the 18th or 19th century.It is uncertain when tomatoes were first added. although it certainly could not have been before the 16th century and the Columbian Exchange. Pizza was sold from open-air stands and out of pizza bakeries until about 1830, when pizzerias in  started to have stanze with tables where clients could sit and eat their pizzas on the spot.A popular legend holds that the archetypal pizza, pizza Margherita, was invented in 1889, when the Royal Palace of Capodimonte commissioned the Neapolitan pizzaiolo Raffaele Esposito to create a pizza in honor of the visiting Queen Margherita. Of the three different pizzas he created, the queen strongly preferred a pizza swathed in the colors of the Italian flag—red  white  and green . Supposedly, this type of pizza was then named after the queen, with an official letter of recognition from the queen's "head of service" remaining to this day on display in Esposito's shop, now called the Pizzeria Brandi. Later research cast doubt on this legend, undermining the authenticity of the letter of recognition, pointing that no media of the period reported about the supposed visit and that both the story and name Margherita were first promoted in the 1930s to the 1940s.Pizza was taken to the United States by Italian immigrants in the late 19th century and first appeared in areas where they concentrated. The country's first pizzeria, Lombardi's, opened in New York City in 1905. Italian Americans migrating from East to West brought the dish with them, and from there, the American version was exported to the rest of the world.The Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana is a non-profit organization founded in 1984. In 2009,  Neapolitan pizza was registered with the European Union as a traditional speciality guaranteed  dish, and in 2017 the art of its making was included on UNESCO's list of intangible cultural heritage.</h3>
