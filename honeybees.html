    <h3>A honey bee  is a  flying insect. they are the bee clade  familiar to humans. The best-known honey bee species is the western honey bee. The only other domesticated species is the eastern honey bee.The only members of  Apis are true honey bees.  other bee species also produce and store honey and have been kept by humans for that purpose, including the stingless bees belonging to the genus Melipona and the Indian stingless or dammar bee Tetragonula iridipennis. Other honey bee secretions such as royal jelly and bee venom are used pharmaceutically, especially in alternative medicine.</h3>

<h2>Origin, systematics, and distribution</h2>
<h3>All honey bees are pollinators native to  Afro-Eurasia. Honey bees appear to have their center of origin in South and Southeast Asia, as all the extant species except Apis mellifera are native to that region. The first Apis bees appear in the fossil record at the Eocene Oligocene boundary.No Apis species existed in the New World.The close relatives of modern honey bees are social , and social behavior is considered to be a trait that predates the origin of the genus. the  basal species make single, exposed combs.</h3>

<h2>Pollination</h2>
<h3>Of all the honey bee species, only A. mellifera has been used  for commercial pollination . The scale of pollination services is  measured in the billions,  adding about 9% to the value of crops. Species of Apis are generalist floral visitors, and pollinate many species of flowering plants.They can provide some pollination to many plants.</h3>
